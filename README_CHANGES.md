# Frontend Adjustments Summary

This document tracks the key frontend updates performed during the latest iteration.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed the inventory card pulse animation so it reliably stops after updates complete.
- Reduced the pulse highlight duration to roughly 1.2 seconds for a snappier feedback loop.
- Updated the Tailwind configuration to use the shorter animation timing and ESM plugin import, satisfying linting rules.
- Added explicit timer cleanup inside `ProductCard` to prevent lingering animation state between stock updates.

## Verification Steps

1. Restart the Vite development server so Tailwind picks up configuration changes.
2. Trigger one or more stock updates via `curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/simulate-stock-update -X POST | jq .`.
3. Confirm each updated product card pulses briefly, then returns to its resting state.
